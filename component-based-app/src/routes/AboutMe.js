        <p1 >I am Prateek, a high achieving Software Engineering student at Monash University, Clayton currently in my penultimate year.
        I am currently working as an intern at Ernst and Young. I like to learn and try new things whenever the opportunity arises. Throughout these years, I have developed a habit to always keep myself busy by challenging myself to do new things.
        </p1>

        <br></br>
        <p1>After work, I like to go to the gym to workout six days a week, followed by a run which helps me refresh myself after hectic work days. When I am not at the gym, I like to play pool, table tennis, socialise with my friends and listen to music to relax my mind .</p1>
